# Welcome to the Developmental branch! 

* This branch contains extra comments and bits of code for testing/other developmental needs. This is where you'll find ToDo notes; notes which are intended to be placeholders or reminders of something to do later. This branch may also contain extra debuging code for debugging/testing purposes. This branch is not optimized for performance. 

* This branch may or may not be stable, meaning this branch may not build correctly or may fail to build/run. This build is not intended for release. 

* This branch will contain documentation.  


# Notes: A collection of general notes. 

* use "std::string_view" instead of "std::string" when read only access is wanted. Make sure to '#include <string_view>'
