# Welcome to the Main branch

* This branch is the live working branch. Not meant for release but may be stable enough for pre-release or alpha/beta release.


# Games 

* My goal is to create a 2D game. I want my game to end up as a representation of my favorite style of video game, an open world RPG. I'd like to have concepts from MineCraft such as; blocks, crafting, and open world. With my own twist on things. And concepts from World of Warcraft such as; quests, and an upgrade tree.

* The following is a list of games that I made, or still working on. 


##  **BREAKOUT GAME**

### Welcome to Breakout game.

* Destroy *all* bricks to clear the level.
* Use 'WASD' or arrow keys to move platform.
* Clear 5 levels for power-up.
* Clear 10 levels for a chance of extra life.
* Clear 10 levels without using a power-up for bonus level.
* Chance of special brick spawning(%10)(%15)(%20) (%25) (%35) (Special bricks will give power-up or chance of extra life, or they may do a magical event(described later). 
* Power-ups can only be used after clearing 1-5 levels, depending on the power-up level. (Higher level power-ups have more effects or higher multipliers) (A power-up may also be intended to be used only on a boss level. If the power-up is not used on the intended level then the power-up will be removed afterwards).
