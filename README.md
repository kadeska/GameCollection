# Welcome to the Release branch!

* This branch is intended for pushing a release build of the program from the Main branch. Do not push from Developmental branch to Release branch, as the Developmental branch contains debug code and is not optimized for release. 

* This branch may contain additional optimizations made after pushing the initial code meant for release. (I will push code from 'master' into 'release' then make appropriate edits for optimization needs. 

* I may eventually use a beautifier to clean out comments.
