###### release 
# Welcome

* This branch is intended for pushing a release build of the program from the 'Main' branch. *Do not* push from 'Developmental' to 'Release' branch, as the 'Developmental' branch contains debug code and is not optimized for release. The 'Developmental' branch is littered with lots of comments and/or other non-essential code meant for debugging/testing inside the dev environment. 

* This branch may contain additional optimizations made after pushing the initial code meant for release. (I will push code from 'Master' into 'Release' then make appropriate edits for optimization needs. 

* I may eventually use a beautifier to clean out comments.
